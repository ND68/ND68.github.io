	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hello, my name is Nathan Dong, the guy in the photo above!<br><br>
	As of 2021, I am a 16 y/o IT Junior attending W.F. Kaynor Technical Highschool.<br>
	I chose to join IT out of the 12 shops because I have a deep passion for working with computers.<br>
	With that being said, it should be pretty clear that I want to pursue a career in a computer related field.<br>
	After college, I dream of becoming a Software Programmer/Developer, but nothing is set in stone.<br><br>
	In my free time, I enjoy messing around on my computer, whether that be practicing typing, <br>
	utilizing cool software, playing video games, or any other computer related thing.<br>
	Since I dream of becoming a programmer, I occasionally do some coding for fun, <br>
	using various websites online.<br><br>
	Now that's enough about myself, let's talk about my digital arts experience!<br><br><br></p>
	<h2>Digital Arts</h2>	
	<p>As explained on my home page, <br>
	I had a ton of fun with the various Adobe Products used throughout the creation of all my digital arts projects.<br>
	Getting to try out all of the apps was definitely a new experience, as there was just so much things to learn!<br><br>
	My favorite apps were definitely Photoshop and Premiere Pro.<br>
	The amount of creative power you get in Photoshop is just insane, with so many tools to use, and setting to configure.<br>
	Premiere was also awesome, as the video creation process was just so fun!<br><br>
	There was some difficulties, and there was definitely a huge learning curve,<br>
	but in the end, I got a great experience out of it.
